# Fundamentals of Data Analysis Project

This repository was created as part of the Fundamentals of Data Analysys Module and contains the following:

- project.ipynb: It contains the entire development of the project, the explanation of all the Iris dataset variables and their behavior.
- iris_dataset.csv: This is the original dataset used to carry out the module project.
- tasks.ipynb: This document contains the 5 tasks carried out throughout the module.
- penguins.csv: This dataset has been used to develop the tasks during the module.
- README.md: Explanatory document about the content of the repository and how to run the Jupyter notebook with the project.

## Instructions to clone the repository and run the Jupyter Notebook.

### Cloning the repository

This project was carried out with a Mac computer, so below I will explain the steps carried out on this machine to clone the repository:

The first step is to have Git installed on your computer.
Once we have Git installed, we need to open Terminal through the Applications -> Utilities folder.
We should navigate to the directory were we want to clone the repository using the command 'cd'.
The next step is to clone the repository using the 'git clone' command followed by the URL of the repository we want to clone, in this case:

```python
git clone https://github.com/StefaniaVerduga/fundamentals-of-data-analysis.git
```

This command will create a new directory with the same name as the repository in our current location and copy the repository files into it.

### Running Jupyter Notebook

Next, I am going to explain how I created and carried out this project in Jupyter Notebook through VSCode.

1. The first step is to install Visual Studio Code and all the needed extensions: Python and Jupyter extensions.
2. Open the folder or workshop where we want to create or open Jupyter Notebooks, in this case the folder where we have our repository. We should create a new Jupyter Notebook by clicking on the "Create a new file" button and saving it with a .ipynb extension.
3. Then, we should select a Kernel and choose the Python interpreter that we want to use for running the notebook.
4. Once all the previous steps are already done, we can run code cells by clicking the "Run Cell" button on the left side of each code cell or by using the keyboard shortcut Shift + Enter.
